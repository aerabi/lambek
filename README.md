# lambek
Lambek is a study of pregroup grammar and a machine translation software using that study. The project is named after Joachim Lambek (1922--2014) which died some days after I started this study, and which is somehow the founder of pregroup grammar.
The project consists of my M.Sc. thesis on "Lambek calculus with applications to German and Persian languages", and some java and scala projects.
